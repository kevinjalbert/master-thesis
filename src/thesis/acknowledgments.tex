\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank the Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS) program for their financial support. I would like to thank UOIT for providing an excellent academic and research environment for the past years I have been a student here.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Jeremy S. Bradbury, for his guidance and wisdom throughout this endeavour. He has been a great supervisor, role-model and colleague. I would like to thank my thesis committee for their insightful feedback and useful comments.

I would like to thank my friends and colleagues within UOIT for being there when a break was needed and for brainstorming ideas. I would like to thank my friends outside of UOIT for being understanding and tolerating the unusual work hours I undertook for research.

I would like to thank my family for their continuous love. My family has always supported every decisions I made, and for that I am grateful. Finally, I would like to thank my fianc\'{e}, Katherine Riess, for her love and support over the last two years and  many more years to come.

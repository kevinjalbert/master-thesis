\chapter*{Abstract}
Mutation testing has traditionally been used to evaluate the effectiveness of test suites and provide confidence in the testing process. Mutation testing involves the creation of many versions of a program each with a single syntactic fault. A test suite is evaluated against these program versions (i.e., mutants) in order to determine the percentage of mutants a test suite is able to identify (i.e., mutation score). A major drawback of mutation testing is that even a small program may yield thousands of mutants and can potentially make the process cost prohibitive. To improve the performance and reduce the cost of mutation testing, we proposed a machine learning approach to predict mutation score based on a combination of source code and test suite metrics. We conducted an empirical evaluation of our approach to evaluated its effectiveness using eight open source software systems.

\section{Conclusions}
\subsection{Conclusions}
\frame{\frametitle{Contributions}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item New approach for predicting mutation scores using source code and test suite metrics.
		\item Demonstrated that feature sets in combination provides more accuracy than individually.
		\item Demonstrated that prediction on unknown data is possible.
		\item Identified a generalizable set of \textit{LIBSVM} parameters that maximize F-score over the test subject.
		\item Demonstrated it is not necessary to train on 90\% in order to achieve near optimal prediction accuracy. 
  \end{itemize}

The use of software metrics to locate faults in source code has been well researched. For example, Koru et al. utilized static software measure along with defect data at the class level to predict bugs using machine learning~\cite{KL05}. Similarly, Gyimothy et al. used object-oriented metrics with logistic regression and machine learning techniques to identify faulty classes in open source software~\cite{GFS05}. Finally, design level metrics were used with a linear prediction model to determine the estimated maintainability and error prone modules of large software systems~\cite{MKPS00}. Our work is unique in comparison to these previous works since we not only use source code metrics but we also use test suite metrics to enhance our predication capabilities.

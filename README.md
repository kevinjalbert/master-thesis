This repository contains the LaTeX source of my M.Sc. Thesis on *Predicting Mutation Scores using Source Code and Test Suite Metrics* done at the [University of Ontario Institute of Technology][1].

If you have questions I will try my best to answer them. Add them as issues, or directly email me. Given the time that has passed since I've done this work, I cannot guarantee I remember deep details anymore.
